# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Introduction
Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer! This web application is designed to visually demonstrate how different pathfinding algorithms work. Built with Svelte and deployed on GitHub Pages, it offers an interactive way to understand these algorithms in action.

## Demo

## Features
- **Interactive Grid:** Customize scenarios with walls and weights.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Choose from algorithms like A* and BFS.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Watch the algorithms in action step-by-step.
- **Responsive Design:** Compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Custom Animation Speed:** Select the Animation speed that best suits you and the algorithm
